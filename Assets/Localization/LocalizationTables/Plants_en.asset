      not as common in the Netherlands anymore due to intensivation of the agricultur.\r\n\u2022
      It does not produce Nectar, just pollen and after pollonation, the petals fall
      off.\r\n\r\nFun Fact: The common poppy might be red to the human's eye, but
      for bees they aren't because of UV absorbation."
